# _Selenium_Session's_
Hello everyone, I wanted to let you all know that I have started a tutorial course on Selenium. The PowerPoint presentations that I have shared are a part of this course. If you are interested in learning Selenium and would like to join this course, please feel free to contact me via email. I would be happy to provide you with more details and help you get started with the course. Thank you!

### _Summary of Session-1_,
- We started by discussing the definition of locators, which are used in Selenium to locate web elements on a page. We covered the different types of locators available in Selenium, including ID, name, class name, tag name, link text, and CSS selectors.
- We also talked about the Same Origin Policy and how to set up Selenium WebDriver in Eclipse, and wrote a basic Selenium test script.
- Overall, we learned how automation testing with Selenium can improve test coverage and reduce costs.


### _Summary of Session-2_,
- We started by discussing the definition of locators, which are used in Selenium to locate web elements on a page. We covered the different types of locators available in Selenium, including ID, name, class name, tag name, link text, and CSS selectors.
- We then talked about best practices for selecting a locator, such as using unique and stable locators, avoiding using dynamic values, and prioritizing readability and maintainability.We demonstrated how to locate web elements using different types of locators, using examples such as finding an element by ID or by class name.
- We discussed the preferred sequence for locators in Selenium, which generally starts with ID, followed by name, class name, and so on, depending on the context and uniqueness of the web element.We explained the difference between Find Element and FindElements in Selenium WebDriver. Find Element returns a single web element that matches the specified locator, while FindElements returns a list of web elements that match the locator.
- Finally, we covered some of the commonly used Selenium WebDriver commands, such as click(), sendKeys(), getText(), and getTitle(). We demonstrated how to use these commands to interact with web elements and retrieve information from web pages.

### _Summary of Session-3_,
- We started by discussing XPath in Selenium, which is used to locate web elements on a page using XML path expressions. We covered the different types of XPath expressions, how to write them, and the concept of independent and dependent XPath.We then talked about synchronization in Selenium, which is used to ensure that the web driver waits for a web element to load before attempting to interact with it. We demonstrated how to use common expected conditions in explicit wait, such as presenceOfElementLocated and visibilityOfElementLocated.
- We discussed about pageLoadTimeout and scriptTimeout in Selenium, which are used to set the maximum time allowed for a web page to load and for a script to execute, respectively. We also covered FluentWait in Selenium, which is a more flexible way to implement synchronization.We discussed exceptions in WebDriver, which are thrown when something goes wrong during the execution of a test script. We covered some of the commonly encountered exceptions, such as ElementNotVisibleException and NoSuchElementException, and demonstrated how to handle them using try-catch blocks.
- We discussed about Chrome Options & Desired Capabilities in Selenium WebDriver, which are used to customize the behavior of the Chrome browser during test automation. We demonstrated how to set options such as headless mode and disable-infobars.Finally, we covered how to handle cookies in Selenium WebDriver, which is used to manage user sessions and authentication. We demonstrated how to add, delete, and retrieve cookies using WebDriver commands.

### _Summary of Session-4_,
- We discussed the differences between Selenium 3 and Selenium 4. We looked at the changes in the architecture, capabilities, and the utility methods for finding elements in Java. We also talked about the modifications made to the Actions class, waits and timeout features, and the new features introduced in Selenium 4.
- We also talked about one of the significant changes in Selenium 4 is the introduction of Object Location and Relative Locators. These features allow you to locate elements easily and perform actions on them. Additionally, we talked about Chrome Dev tools, which can be used to debug and inspect web pages.
- Another topic we covered was the capture screenshot of specific web element. With Selenium 4, you can take screenshots of specific web elements rather than the entire page. We also discussed how to open a new tab or window in the browser using Selenium 4.
