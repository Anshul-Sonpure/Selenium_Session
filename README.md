# _Selenium_Session's_
Hello everyone, I wanted to let you all know that I have started a tutorial course on Selenium. The PowerPoint presentations that I have shared are a part of this course. If you are interested in learning Selenium and would like to join this course, please feel free to contact me via email. I would be happy to provide you with more details and help you get started with the course. Thank you!

### _Summary of Session-1_,
- We started by discussing the definition of locators, which are used in Selenium to locate web elements on a page. We covered the different types of locators available in Selenium, including ID, name, class name, tag name, link text, and CSS selectors.
- We also talked about the Same Origin Policy and how to set up Selenium WebDriver in Eclipse, and wrote a basic Selenium test script.
- Overall, we learned how automation testing with Selenium can improve test coverage and reduce costs.


### _Summary of Session-2_,
- We started by discussing the definition of locators, which are used in Selenium to locate web elements on a page. We covered the different types of locators available in Selenium, including ID, name, class name, tag name, link text, and CSS selectors.
- We then talked about best practices for selecting a locator, such as using unique and stable locators, avoiding using dynamic values, and prioritizing readability and maintainability.We demonstrated how to locate web elements using different types of locators, using examples such as finding an element by ID or by class name.
- We discussed the preferred sequence for locators in Selenium, which generally starts with ID, followed by name, class name, and so on, depending on the context and uniqueness of the web element.We explained the difference between Find Element and FindElements in Selenium WebDriver. Find Element returns a single web element that matches the specified locator, while FindElements returns a list of web elements that match the locator.
- Finally, we covered some of the commonly used Selenium WebDriver commands, such as click(), sendKeys(), getText(), and getTitle(). We demonstrated how to use these commands to interact with web elements and retrieve information from web pages.
