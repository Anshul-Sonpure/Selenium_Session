# _Selenium_Session's_
Hello everyone, I wanted to let you all know that I have started a tutorial course on Selenium. The PowerPoint presentations that I have shared are a part of this course. If you are interested in learning Selenium and would like to join this course, please feel free to contact me via email. I would be happy to provide you with more details and help you get started with the course. Thank you!

### _Summary of Session-1_,


- We discussed the benefits of automation testing over manual testing, introduced Selenium as an open-source tool for automation testing, and covered its architecture and components.
- We also talked about the Same Origin Policy and how to set up Selenium WebDriver in Eclipse, and wrote a basic Selenium test script.
- Overall, we learned how automation testing with Selenium can improve test coverage and reduce costs.
