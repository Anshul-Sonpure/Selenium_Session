### _Summary of Session-3_,
- We started by discussing XPath in Selenium, which is used to locate web elements on a page using XML path expressions. We covered the different types of XPath expressions, how to write them, and the concept of independent and dependent XPath.We then talked about synchronization in Selenium, which is used to ensure that the web driver waits for a web element to load before attempting to interact with it. We demonstrated how to use common expected conditions in explicit wait, such as presenceOfElementLocated and visibilityOfElementLocated.
- We discussed about pageLoadTimeout and scriptTimeout in Selenium, which are used to set the maximum time allowed for a web page to load and for a script to execute, respectively. We also covered FluentWait in Selenium, which is a more flexible way to implement synchronization.We discussed exceptions in WebDriver, which are thrown when something goes wrong during the execution of a test script. We covered some of the commonly encountered exceptions, such as ElementNotVisibleException and NoSuchElementException, and demonstrated how to handle them using try-catch blocks.
- We discussed about Chrome Options & Desired Capabilities in Selenium WebDriver, which are used to customize the behavior of the Chrome browser during test automation. We demonstrated how to set options such as headless mode and disable-infobars.Finally, we covered how to handle cookies in Selenium WebDriver, which is used to manage user sessions and authentication. We demonstrated how to add, delete, and retrieve cookies using WebDriver commands.
